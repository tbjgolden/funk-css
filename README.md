> **A preprocessor built for functional CSS**

```none
[ Funk ] <-> [ CSS ] <---> [ JS ]
                |            |
                '->[ HTML ]<-'
```

Functional CSS (also known as Atomic/Utility) - is the principle of creating a
stylesheet that largely follows a 1 CSS property-value pair to 1 CSS class
relationship.

This single constraint has some very useful qualities:

- predictable class names that are easy to remember
- massive CSS size benefits
- far easier to review each others styling code
- consistency and conformity

However, other CSS preprocessors do not make great solutions for this, as they:

- require you to work out the right class name for each property-value pair
- leave plenty of room for you to get this wrong

The following is the API that this will use - though the project is a work in
progress.
